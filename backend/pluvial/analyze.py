"""The address-mode pipeline, from a typed address to nine fetched points.

This is the part that spends money, so it is split at exactly the point
where money starts being spent:

    plan(...)   geocode, build the sample plan, quote.  Spends NOTHING.
    fetch(...)  batch-fetch the planned points.          Spends the quote.

Nothing calls `fetch` without a user having seen and confirmed a `plan`.
That gate is the same one `MireyeToolWrapper` enforces on agents: the system
may propose a purchase, only a person may authorise one.
