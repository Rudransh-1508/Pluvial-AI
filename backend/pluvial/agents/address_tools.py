"""Function tools for the address-mode cascade.

Different from `agents/tools.py` in one structural way that everything else
follows from: `sampled_profiles` returns per-point values keyed by
`sample_id` rather than one blended profile. That is what lets a claim name
the point it was read at, and it is the whole reason the map can bind an
argument to a coordinate.

`neighbourhood_complaints` and `dossier_lookup` are deliberately absent.
There is no 311 feed in the product and no street segment to hold a
dossier — an address-mode agent argues from ground physics and consequence,
or it does not argue.
